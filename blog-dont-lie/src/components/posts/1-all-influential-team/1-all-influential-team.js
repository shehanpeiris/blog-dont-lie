    <h1>My All-Influential Team</h1>
    <p>A fun, thought-provoking tweet came across my timeline during the dead portion of the NBA offseason and, as I am wont to do, I thought about it for far too long.</p>
    <p>I pondered this for a while and even drafted a tweet in response. Upon further reflection, it was an absorbing question with too many good answers for 280 characters to do it justice. Instead, I opted to save it for you, the <s>people of Gotham</s> reader(s) of Blog Don't Lie.</p>
    <p>After much deliberation, I came up with a 9-man rotation. I'm focusing solely on the "influential" part of Justin's question—these are the players that have molded the way I think about basketball.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Draymond Green</h3>
    <p>Nobody has shaped the way I think about defense more than Draymond Green. It's easy to spot all the events that take place on defense—a steal, a deflection, an emasculating rejection. Draymond does all these things fantastically well, but that's not what makes him special.</p>
    <p>The reason defense is so hard to quantify is that defense is more about the absence of events—the shot that is dissuaded, the drive that is stymied before it begins, the mismatch that evaporates before the offense can capitalize. Draymond's defensive precognition allows him to proactively shut down offensive plays before they even start. He has changed the way I look at defense, helping me focus on the events that never occur.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>LeBron James</h3>
    <p>I grew up idolizing Michael Jordan. As a result, I was narrow-minded in my idea of what the best basketball player should look like and the role he/she should fill on their team. LeBron didn't do the same things that Jordan did, so how could Bron possibly be on the same level?</p>
    <p>Maybe the next GOAT candidate will remind us of Jordan or LeBron. But LeBron has taught me not to restrict my definition of basketball greatness to what I've already seen.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>2004 Pistons</h3>
    <p>This team is the reason I obsess over fit, roles, and the synergies between players. These Pistons fit together so unbelievably well. Everyone knew their roles. They had JUST enough of everything you need to win big, and that was solely because of how well they played together and distinctly NOT because of the individual talent on their roster.</p>
    <p>The lessons I learned from the mid-2000s Pistons shape how I think about great teams today. Most contenders have more star power than those Pistons, but every great team needs role players, a hive mind and an identity.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Stephen Curry</h3>
    <p>I didn't think it was physically possible to shoot this well. Steph has made "gravity" common parlance on #NBATwitter, and it's because no player in the history of the league has more frequently made well-oiled defenses look like youth soccer teams. He has reframed my entire perspective about how to build around your best player and the limits (or lack thereof) of incendiary shooting.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Nikola Jokic</h3>
    <p>Jokic has made me question long-held beliefs about the need for "traditional" perimeter creation for high-level offensive success. I still think the Nuggets (or any team Jokic plays for) will ultimately need someone who can initiate offense as a primary ballhandler from the perimeter, if only to close playoff games. But the more I watch Big Honey, the more I start to wonder if he can actually do this thing himself.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Tim Duncan</h3>
    <p>Tim Duncan made me rethink how to evaluate true impact on winning with the endless positive contributions he made to the San Antonio Spurs dynasty. Whether it was rock-solid screens, consistent defensive rotations or being (from afar at least) the perfect teammate, Duncan did so many little things that compounded to make him the bedrock for a culture that resulted in two decades' worth of sustained brilliance, professionalism and adaptability.</p>
    <p>Culture matters, and Duncan is my constant reminder of that inescapable truth.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Manu Ginobili</h3>
    <p>I love Manu for a multitude of reasons, but he earned his place on this list because he gave me a completely new perspective on lineups and the patterns of a 48-minute NBA game. By embracing his 6th-man role, Ginobili optimized San Antonio's 48 minutes. Spurs benches ran roughshod over the league for most of Ginobili's career, largely because he was willing to accept a sixth-man role that more optimally distributed the Spurs' sources of shot creation.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Kyle Lowry</h3>
    <p>For a non-Raptors fan, I've thought about Kyle Lowry a lot over the last few years. He fascinates me because he symbolizes the importance of hierarchy on a team. If Kyle Lowry is your best player (as he was for so long in Toronto), your team has a hard ceiling. But slot Lowry to the #2 spot and magical things can happen. He has shaped the way I think about non-shot-creating stars and the tremendous (and necessary) value they add to championship-level teams.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Dirk Nowitzki</h3>
    <p>Watching Dirk Nowizki uncovered a new realm of possibilities regarding shot versatility. I had seen the Reggie Miller shooter archetype and its offspring (the souped-up Ray Allen version and the shorter-range Rip Hamilton model). Nowitzki's unparalleled combination of size, shooting stroke and shot diversity was a whole other animal.</p>
