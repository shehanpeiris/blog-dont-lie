# Blog Don't Lie

### What Does it All Mean?
I had a Wordpress blog about the NBA. Now that I feel confident in my coding skills, I figured I may as well build that blog entirely on my own using React to achieve the following:
* combine my two greatest passions (coding and basketball)
* keep my skills fresh by building out new pages in my blog consistently
* utilize my coding abilities to build some unique basketball content

### How It's Made
* Front End: React
  * Is this the *best* tool for building a blog? Probably not. But I love React. I love the speed that comes with its virtual DOM. I love the reusability of components. I love passing data with props and state. So welcome to my React blog!
* Back End: Express
  * This is running on an Express server.
* Database: Firebase (TBD)
  * I need to do more thinking about what I **truly** need from my database. As of right now, I'm only thinking about using it to render the article cards, in which case Firebase can do the job nicely. If I need more structured data, maybe I'll switch to MySQL.
